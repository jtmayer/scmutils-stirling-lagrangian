# scmutils-stirling-lagrangian
Simulation of a Stirling engine in MIT Scheme using the scmutils library. Some of the functions in the scmutils library were modified to support path dependent Lagrangians, which are needed to simulate heat engines. Minimizing the action of a path dependent Lagrangian is slow to compute due to the need to the integral within the Lagrangian.
